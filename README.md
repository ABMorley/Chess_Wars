# Chess_App
 Chess app made using Unity and C#.  This was created as a project to improve my coding skills over winter break.  Also, I plan to help others learn to code using this project.  I will make tutorials on how I made this app for the University of Minnesota's App Developers Club (and potentially YouTube as well).

 Features  
 -Click to move  
 -Black and White can win/lose the game  
 -Switches players  
 -Restart the game at the end  
 
 Planned Features  
 -Starting jump move for pawns  
 -Check for Check  
 -Check for Checkmate  
 -Castling (Rook and King switch)  
 -Saving and Loading a game  
 
 Needs Testing/Improvement  
 -Porting to Android and IOS devices  
 -The script names should be changed  
 -The offsets for matrix -> world coordinates should be constants to adhere to coding standards  

 Additional Notes  
  -If the camera is not the correct aspect ratio for a phone, switch to the game view in Unity.  Switch the aspect ratio to 9:16 (left corner by "Display 1").  
  -If some chess pieces do not appear navigate to Assets > Assets > Sprites and right click and select Reimport.  Keep doing this until they all appear (I hope they fix this annoying Unity bug soon).
