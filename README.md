# Chess_App
 Chess app made using Unity and C#.  This was created as a project to improve my coding skills over winter break.  Also, I plan to help others learn to code using this project.  I will make tutorials on how I made this app for the University of Minnesota's App Developers Club (and potentially YouTube as well).

 Tutorial  
 -Go to the TUTORIAL folder for pdf's about how to make this app step-by-step  
 -The .zip files have the Unity Project after the workshop was completed  
 -If you want to follow, for example, Workshop 3, you should download the Workshop 2's zip in order to have what you need   

 Features  
 -Click to move  
 -Black and White can win/lose the game  
 -Switches players  
 -Restart the game at the end  
 
 Additional Possible Features  
 -Starting jump move for pawns  
 -Check for Check  
 -Check for Checkmate  
 -Castling (Rook and King switch)  
 -Saving and Loading a game  
 
 What can be improved  
 -Porting to Android and IOS devices  
 -The offsets for matrix -> world coordinates should be constants to adhere to coding standards  
 -Duplicated code for combining 

 Additional Notes  
  -If the camera is not the correct aspect ratio for a phone, switch to the game view in Unity.  Switch the aspect ratio to 9:16 (left corner by "Display 1").  
  -Unity version 2019.3.0f3
